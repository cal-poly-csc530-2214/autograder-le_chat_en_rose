autograder-le_chat_en_rose created by GitHub Classroom

this Autograder is based off the program written by Rishabh Singh, Sumit Gulwani and, Armando Solar-Lezama. The testing program that i have decided to use looks at the
question *The function will be given an unordered array of integers named nums and a 2nd input of type integer called target. Return the indices of two numbers such that these two numbers add up to the target. Each of the output indices must be distinct. You may return the two indices in any order.*
starting off with the project i created my base anwser in which to make comparisons and then started seeding the common errors that users can have. This proved difficult as i didnt have a lot of previous data from students but i used HackerEarth and HackerRank to find like anwsers.
