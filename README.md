this Autograder is based off the program written by Rishabh Singh, Sumit Gulwani and, Armando Solar-Lezama. The testing program that we have decided to use looks at the
question *The function will be given an unordered array of integers named nums and a 2nd input of type integer called target. Return the indices of two numbers such that these two numbers add up to the target. Each of the output indices must be distinct. You may return the two indices in any order.*

**Summery**
starting off with the project we created our base anwser in which to make comparisons and then started seeding the common errors that users can have. This proved difficult as we didnt have a lot of previous data from students but we used HackerEarth and HackerRank to find like anwsers.
After createing our base program in which to start the testing with we followed the guidelines set fort from the paper to create an eml list to take the python and eml and make an mypy program. The error cases that we are looking at is indexing of the arrays as well as the comparisons dictated in the paper. This proved to be much harder than anticipated first starting with reg expression but also looking at s expression matching to add in the needed clauses for the mypy language. we decided to go with the inbuilt string matching feature which may not be as robust but can be evolved later to acccepte other more poorly written programs.
